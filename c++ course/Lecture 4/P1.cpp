/*
Variable scope : scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of a 
variable is valid.

based on scope we have local and global variables in c++.
Local variables: these are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed from there only .
Global variables:these are declared outside the function and can be called from anywhere .


                                    DATA TYPES :  Data types are used to define the type of
         data a variable can hold. They are essential for memory management and ensuring that operations on variables are valid.

1. Built-in Data Types
These are the fundamental data types provided by the C++ language itself.

Integer Types:
int, short, long, long long, unsigned

Floating-Point Types:
float, double, long double

Character Type:
char

Boolean Type:
bool

Void Type:
void


2. User-Defined Data Types
These are data types that users create based on built-in types.

Structure (struct)
Class
Union
Enumeration (enum)
Typedef (to create an alias for an existing type)


3. Derived Data Types
These are derived from built-in or user-defined types.

Array
Pointer
Reference
Function
